## Know the Concepts
#### Q:  What are the reasons programmer’s have trouble with scheduling?

A:  1. Programmers don’t always schedule time for meetings or other non-coding
activities that make up every day. 2.  Programmers often underestimate feedback times (how long it takes to pass change requests and approvals back and forth) for projects. 3.  Programmers don’t always understand the full scope of what they are producing. 4.  Programmers often have to estimate a schedule on a totally different kind of project than they are used to, and thus are unable to schedule accurately. 5.  Programmers often underestimate the amount of time it takes to get a program fully robust.


#### Q:  Find your favorite program, and try to use it in a completely wrong manner. Open up files of the wrong type, choose invalid options, close windows that are supposed to be open, etc. Count how many different error scenarios they had to account for.

A: This will be done in `add-year`

#### Q:  What are corner cases? Can you list examples of numeric corner cases?

A: Corner cases are the inputs that are most likely to cause problems or behave unexpectedly.


#### Q: Why is user testing so important?

A: Users enter data that makes sense to them.Allowing non-programmers to use your program for testing purposes usually gives you much more accurate results as to how robust your program truly is.


#### Q: What are stubs and drivers used for? What’s the difference between the two?

A: stubs simply returns the values that function needs to proceed.  driver simply loads your function, supply it with data, and check the results. stubs is used for the case which function is not fininshed.


#### Q: What are recovery points used for?

A:  Recovery points are basic units for error recovery,y reducing the number of error-handling mechanism.


#### Q:How many different error codes should a program have?

A: it depends on the program.As many as possible
